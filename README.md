# Interactive gift popup

## What is this?

This is a simple Python GUI application made with Tkinter. It displays a pop-up window with a playful question and two buttons: "Yes!" and "No, I hate you". If the user clicks "Yes!", a loading message appears and, after 5 seconds, a link is opened in the browser. If the user tries to click "No", the button moves to a random position in the window, making it impossible to click.

## What can it be used for?

- Fun interactive gifts for friends or loved ones
- Small pranks or playful surveys
- Demonstrating basic Tkinter GUI and event handling
- Learning about button positioning and randomization in GUIs

## Where can it be used?

- On any computer with Python installed (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- In classrooms for teaching GUI basics
- As a playful pop-up in personal projects
- As a template for more advanced interactive applications

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the code in a file, for example `hello.py`.
3. Run the file using the command:
   ```
   python hello.py
   ```
4. Enjoy the interactive window!
